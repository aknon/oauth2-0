########### request forward ##############
reqquest diapather uses relative path avoiding the app name

like app-->ressource

at resource say "r1"
this resource forwards to "r2"
then 	request.getRequestDispatcher("/r2").forward(request,  response) will ,

BUT 	request.getRequestDispatcher("/app/r2").forward(request,  response) 	will NOT WORK

###### request redirect #####################
This needs a URI from the app name. Since it is inteperted by the browser which computes realtive urls from the domain name., not the app name

App name is used only internally by the servers. So all enteries in the web.sml assume HOME = domain/app

where as browsers assume HOME = domain

So for Redirects

say resource say "r1"
this resource redirects to "r2"
then 	request.sendRedirect("/r2) will NOT WORK,

BUT 	request.sendRedirect("/app/r2") will work

######## For Relative Urls in the Images and Scritps tag ###################
Follow the same principle as that of Request Redirect

Use relative URI from the app name , not the ones given in the web.xml.

Like path of script is /app/scripts/a.js

then the Script tag must have src="/app/scripts/a.js". This will work

but src="/srcipts/a.js" will NOT WORK

Same is true for images

#############

<%= %>
is same as respone.print()

##### cannot forward twice ######

	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
			throws IOException, ServletException {
		
		
		getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/loginapp").forward(request, response); 
		
		if ( loginFailed(request, response)) {
			getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/errorapp").forward(request, response)
		return;
		}


** getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/errorapp").forward(request, response) --fails . Cannot forward once the response is committed

############ Weired Ness with Chrmoe ######

it does not store cokies for localhost:
so url : http://localhost:8080/restful/clientapp
has a script that does : docuemn.cookie = "new cookie"

This does no work. IT works with Chrome though

Hhoweever when the Url's localhost is replaced with actual ip address ie.
url : http://10.10.61.111:8080/restful/clientapp

the page is able to set cookies, in chrome. Obviosly it does in firefox too !!

Seems chrome does it intentionally ;
